# password_trivial
## Is your password trivial to crack?
Run password against list ([rockyou.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RockYou#Data_breach)) to see if it is trivially cracked.

This doesn't guarentee that your password is secure, but at least that it is not immediately crackable.

The program depends on having `rockyou.txt` installed in the the folder with the program. Github does not allow files this big to be uploaded, so you can download it yourself [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt).
